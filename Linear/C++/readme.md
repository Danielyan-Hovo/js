This is a programm to solve linear equations
To compile write 'make' in terminal
Then write 'make test' to run programm
After type 'make clean' to clan all excessive files 
Input files name is inputLinear.txt 
Each line is one test 
They are given in format "first_number space second_number"
like this:
12 54
You can see compared answers of algorithm and golden answers in resultLinear.txt
In left side are answers that we calculated ourselves
In the middle are algorythm answers
And in right side are compareing results
