This is a programm to solve quadratic equations
To compile write 'make' in terminal
Then write 'make test' to run programm
After type 'make clean' to clan all excessive files 
Input files name is inputQudrate.txt 
Each line is one test 
They are given in format "first_number space second_number space third_number"
like this:
12 54 31
You can see compared answers of algorithm and golden answers in resultQuadrate.txt
In left side are answers that we calculated ourselves
In the middle are algorythm answers
And in right side are compareing results
