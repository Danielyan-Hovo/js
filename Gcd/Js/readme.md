This is a Gsd algorythm in Js realized recursively
Write 'make' in terminal to run programm
Then write 'make clean' to remove all generated files
Input files name is input.txt 
Each line is one test 
They are given in format "first_number space second_number"
like this:
12 54
You can see compared answers of algorithm and golden answers in result.txt
In left side are answers that we calculated ourselves
In the middle are algorythm answers
And in right side are compareing results
